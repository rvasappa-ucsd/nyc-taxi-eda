ðŸš– NYC Taxi Data Exploratory Analysis
A comprehensive data analysis framework using Apache Spark and Jupyter Notebook for exploring and analyzing NYC Taxi trip data.

Project Overview
This repository contains a Spark-based exploratory data analysis of the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding trip patterns, fare structures, tipping behavior, and other insights from the taxi data.

Approach:

1. Environment Setup
  
2. Data Engineering

Data Ingestion Method: Parquet format for optimized performance
Feature Engineering: Created temporal, spatial, and financial derived features
Data Cleaning: Removed outliers and invalid records

3. Analysis Components

Temporal Analysis: Patterns by hour, day, month, and weekday vs. weekend
Financial Analysis: Fare structure and tipping behavior
Trip Characteristics: Distance, duration, and speed relationships
Geospatial Analysis: Pickup and dropoff location patterns

4. Visualization
Various visualizations to understand patterns in the data:

Trip distribution by hour
Fare amount relationships
Weekday vs. weekend comparisons
Correlation analysis
